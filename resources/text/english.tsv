200	Once upon a time, two gods fought each other in your sky.
201	The god of love...
202	And the god of death...
203	Two great and powerful foxes who bit and tore with gnarled maws.
204	Until one day a fatal blow was struck on death and she curled, defeated.
205	Now there is but one god.
206	Our indignant and vicious god who bleeds red between the stars.
207	With love the victor, and death defeated, spirits are no longer led to their proper rest.
208	The dead rise and wander under her misshapen body.
209	Empty vessels remain where souls once were.
210	Bones refuse to settle.
211	Spirits twist and churn into beasts...
212	Destroying all in their path...
213	Seeking an end to their suffering.
214	We pray for love, for she is all that stands before annihilation.
215	Sometimes those that love are stained red.
216	Kissed by those rabid and endless fangs.
217	They are changed wondrous by their passion.
218	Molded by their supernatural devotion.
219	Gifted with otherworldly power.
220	These folk are the sirens amongst the twilight sea.
221	The only hope for a spirit to close its eyes.
222	Songbirds.
223	What does it feel to wake up surrounded by a sea of corpses?
224	Who's there?!
225	Friends...
226	Family...
227	Fools...
228	All reduced to minced flesh, but unable to die...
229	Is this Jigoku?...
230	I don't fear you demon!
231	If for my karma, my destiny is to live in Arbuda...
232	So it'll be!
233	You fool...
234	Death is long forgotten.
235	You may call me Unseelie.
236	Rin.
237	Very good Rin.
238	Now...
239	Let me read you what the future departs...
